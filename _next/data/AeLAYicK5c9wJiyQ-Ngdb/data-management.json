Synthetic data is data that’s generated programmatically. For example, photorealistic images of objects in arbitrary scenes can be rendered using video game engines or audio generated by a speech synthesis model from the known text. It’s not unlike traditional data augmentation, where crops, flips, rotations, and distortions are used to increase the variety of data that models have to learn from. Synthetically generated data takes those same concepts even further."]]},"created_time":1645635892065,"last_edited_time":1645635840000,"parent_id":"4f6aae13-77aa-40ad-a5fb-7db5b90c3ae3","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"434895d5-f65b-42d6-85c4-97c0d8f141ba":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"434895d5-f65b-42d6-85c4-97c0d8f141ba","version":2,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Most of today’s synthetic data is visual.
