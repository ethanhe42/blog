This intuitive method selects an input, performs a forward pass, computes the gradient with respect to the pixels, and visualizes the gradients. Essentially, how much does a unit change in the value of the input’s pixels affect the prediction of the model? This is a straightforward and common method. Similar to the challenge with attention, the explanations may not be correct, and the overall method is fragile and sensitive to small changes."]]},"created_time":1645644455280,"last_edited_time":1645644420000,"parent_id":"f9e18efc-827a-4f89-a8fc-e8975dcadc02","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"4b4b46bf-98fa-476b-bf58-52d98a4f90f2":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"4b4b46bf-98fa-476b-bf58-52d98a4f90f2","version":2,"type":"sub_sub_header","properties":{"title":[["Understand The Contribution of Training Data Points To The Prediction",[["b"]]]]},"created_time":1645644455280,"last_edited_time":1645644420000,"parent_id":"f9e18efc-827a-4f89-a8fc-e8975dcadc02","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"9e9812a7-11ab-4850-9b92-b5c208f1c656":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"9e9812a7-11ab-4850-9b92-b5c208f1c656","version":2,"type":"image","properties":{"source":[["https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-10-notes-media/image18.png"]]},"created_time":1645644455280,"last_edited_time":1645644420000,"parent_id":"f9e18efc-827a-4f89-a8fc-e8975dcadc02","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"35223d13-3d0b-4d7d-8be7-e8dade731e90":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"35223d13-3d0b-4d7d-8be7-e8dade731e90","version":2,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Instead of focusing on features and their explicit relevance to the prediction, we can also take a hard look at the training data points themselves."]]},"created_time":1645644455280,"last_edited_time":1645644420000,"parent_id":"f9e18efc-827a-4f89-a8fc-e8975dcadc02","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"f9be0e13-e78d-4956-9a12-5ed9fbea6d35":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"f9be0e13-e78d-4956-9a12-5ed9fbea6d35","version":2,"type":"bulleted_list","properties":{"title":[["Prototypes and criticisms",[["b"]]],[" are one such approach, though it is less applicable to deep learning.
