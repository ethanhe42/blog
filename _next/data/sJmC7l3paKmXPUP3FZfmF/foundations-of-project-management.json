If you are working on a project that requires people with medical expertise and you hire people who do not have a medical background, no matter how hard that team works, they will not have the right skill set to complete the project. As project manager, you should bring on people with the right skills and ensure the team knows that each individual is valued, trusted, and appreciated. You can demonstrate how you feel about the team’s value by allowing them to have input and ask questions, and by addressing their needs as soon as possible."]]},"created_time":1646635786339,"last_edited_time":1646635740000,"parent_id":"7c5f4cc9-b8a0-498e-8484-ccc1dbf41912","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"8fa5210e-a90d-4466-bf8d-18aeea1e315c":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"8fa5210e-a90d-4466-bf8d-18aeea1e315c","version":2,"type":"image","properties":{"source":[["https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wElcha82RcCJXIWvNgXAUA_2f5c4ac359fa4a5e87b9ca3f7c558db7_C1M2L1R1_C.png?expiry=1646784000000&hmac=iCgCBppJCnYxNG3BwXRBBnmM036k_Glk-edFgVCD0VQ"]]},"created_time":1646635786339,"last_edited_time":1646635740000,"parent_id":"7c5f4cc9-b8a0-498e-8484-ccc1dbf41912","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"3ca01644-3a45-45ca-8fb3-71551f988d89":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"3ca01644-3a45-45ca-8fb3-71551f988d89","version":2,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Maintaining customer satisfaction and building a great team are two ways that you, as a project manager, can add value to a project.

For example, if a graphic designer working on marketing materials for your project doesn't understand the customer’s overall goal to appeal to educators, they may not be able to fully capture the vision for the campaign.

One of Avi’s team members, Miguel, said that he needed to start his workday early because he picked his children up from school at 3:00. After hearing this, Avi avoided scheduling team meetings in the late afternoon. Another team member, Elisa, told Avi that she preferred face-to-face or phone conversations to email since she felt like she communicated better verbally. When Avi needed to discuss something with Elisa, he made sure that he talked with her in person as much as possible.
