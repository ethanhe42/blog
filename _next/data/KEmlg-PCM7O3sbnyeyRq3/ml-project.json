As seen below, on the left, where we are starting to approach or exceed the baseline, we need to be mindful of overfitting and perhaps incorporate regularization of some sort. On the right, where the baseline hugely exceeds our model’s performance, we clearly have a lot of work to do to improve the model and address its underfitting."]]},"created_time":1645635788797,"last_edited_time":1645635780000,"parent_id":"fcd4d688-6b0e-4ee7-8838-53a4d48a0af4","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"e4b70bc9-cc72-4924-9a72-1e999ea02328":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"e4b70bc9-cc72-4924-9a72-1e999ea02328","version":2,"type":"image","properties":{"source":[["https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/lecture-5-notes-media/image1.png"]]},"created_time":1645635788797,"last_edited_time":1645635780000,"parent_id":"fcd4d688-6b0e-4ee7-8838-53a4d48a0af4","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"c69c1473-4929-4ffd-b76a-a5bcbc0dc996":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"c69c1473-4929-4ffd-b76a-a5bcbc0dc996","version":2,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["There are a number of sources to help us define useful baselines.
