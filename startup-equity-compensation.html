practice of granting partial ownership in a company in exchange for work. In its ideal form, equity compensation aligns the interests of individual employees with the goals of the company they work for, which can yield dramatic results in team building, innovation, and longevity of employment. Each of these <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#history-and-significance">contributes</a> to the creation of value—for a company, for its users and customers, and for the individuals who work to make it a success.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-acabc06468c54c3a854f0d7b91c2cd6e">The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#how-equity-is-granted">ways equity can be granted</a> as compensation—including restricted stock, stock options, and restricted stock units—are <b>notoriously complex</b>. Equity compensation involves confounding terminology, legal obscurities, and many high-stakes decisions for those who give and receive it.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-ec4614d553104269a5db58573fb61ad8">If you talk to enough employees and hiring managers, you’ll hear stories of how they or their colleagues met with the painful consequences of not learning enough up front. Though many people learn the basic ideas from personal experience or from colleagues or helpful friends who have been through it before, the intricacies of equity compensation are best understood by tax attorneys, corporate lawyers, and other professionals.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-239ba94516d44193b3ec8f8680e54a2e">Decisions related to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#offers-and-negotiations">negotiating an offer</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#stock-option-scenarios">exercising stock options</a>, in particular, can have <b>major financial consequences</b>.

Now, Holloway is pleased to publish this new edition of the Guide. We’ve expanded sections, added resources and visuals, and filled in gaps.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-7d7b5d7e567549afa2ece0910961632e">There is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#further-reading">a lot of information</a> about equity compensation spread across blogs and articles that focus on specific components of the topic, such as vesting, types of stock options, or equity levels. We believe there is a need for a consolidated and shared resource, written by and for people on different sides of compensation decisions, including employees, hiring managers, founders, and students. Anyone can feel overwhelmed by the complex details and high-stakes personal choices that this topic involves. This reference exists to answer the needs of beginners and the more experienced.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-f2f553a18e1f4b2989bc583becb831fc">Holloway and our contributors are motivated by a single purpose: To help readers understand important details and their contexts well enough to make better decisions themselves. The Guide aims to be <b>practical</b> (with concrete suggestions and pitfalls to avoid), <b>thoughtful</b> (with context and multiple expert perspectives, including divergent opinion on controversial topics), and <b>concise</b> (it is dense but contains only notable details—still, it’s at least a three-hour read, with links to three hundred sources!).</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-c604b40558114191a7eb0774ad06b486">The Guide does not purport to be either perfect or complete.

The authors and editors of this Guide have navigated the territory of equity compensation from the perspective of employees, hiring managers, founders, and lawyers. We do believe that the knowledge here, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#seeking-professional-advice">combined with professional advice</a>, can make a significant difference for <b>both employees and hiring managers</b>.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-e7190ef3c6bd49fea137ddcbc3f01faf">One of the difficulties for candidates negotiating equity compensation is that they may have less information about what they are worth than the person hiring them.

While some data on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#typical-employee-equity-levels">typical equity levels</a> have been published online, much of it fails to represent the value of a candidate with their own specific experience in a specific role.

Founders and hiring managers also often struggle with talking through the web of technicalities with potential hires, and can make equally poor decisions when making offers. Either over-compensating or under-compensating employees can have unfortunate consequences.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-5038ec87357c41e2ac16f4191b52e5a8">In short, both companies and employees are routinely hurt by uninformed decisions and costly mistakes when it comes to equity compensation.

As a company issues stock and raises money, the smaller percentage of the company you <em>do</em> have could be worth more. The size of your slice gets relatively smaller, but, if the company is growing, the size of the cake gets bigger. For example, a typical startup might have three rounds of funding, with each round of funding issuing 20% more shares. At the end of the three rounds, there are more outstanding shares—roughly 73% more in this case, since 120%×120%×120% is 173%—and each shareholder owns proportionally less of the company.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-9aa112d56e03472fb3015c6507faf2eb">🄳 The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)"><b>valuation</b></a> of the company is the present value investors believe the company has.

In the context of compensation, founders, executives, and employees typically gain rights to their grant of equity incrementally over time, subject to restrictions. People may refer to their shares or stock options vesting, or may say that a person is vesting or has fully vested.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-42f7887b4d9e4b2792faf89582b42f13">🄳 In the majority of cases, vesting occurs incrementally over time, according to a <b>vesting schedule</b>. A person vests only while they work for the company. If the person quits or is terminated immediately, they get no equity, and if they stay for years, they’ll get most or all of it.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-ec84c653fa484dff9e091ac844a66f4a">Awards of stock, stock options, and RSUs are almost always subject to a vesting schedule.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-c09a8a70d8f64ea381b51e20fd753ec6">🄳 Vesting schedules can have a <b>cliff</b> designating a length of time that a person must work before they vest at all.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-8e0c29ff8aea4a119508a3e9611b05a5">For example, if your equity award had a one-year cliff and you only worked for the company for 11 months, you would not get anything, since you haven’t vested in any part of your award. Similarly, if the company is sold within a year of your arrival, depending on what your paperwork says, you may receive nothing on the sale of the company.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-9130a74b2b6c45d9922c6cb96c4c8138">A very common vesting schedule is vesting over <b>4 years</b>, with a <b>1 year</b> cliff. This means you get 0% vesting for the first 12 months, 25% vesting at the 12th month, and 1/48th (2.08%) more vesting each month until the 48th month. If you leave just before a year is up, you get nothing, but if you leave after 3 years, you get 75%.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-b7a1a529d9944e739ca49314be133e8a">🄳 In some cases, vesting may be triggered by specific events outside of the vesting schedule, according to contractual terms called <b>accelerated vesting (or acceleration)</b>. Two kinds of accelerated vesting that are commonly negotiated are if the company is sold or undergoes a merger (<b>single trigger</b>) or if it’s sold and the person is fired (<b>double trigger</b>).</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-c806b1e0615e4e84ac6b9502b2e401a7">🌪 Cliffs are an important topic.

However, the flip side of vesting with cliffs is that if an employee is leaving—quits or is laid off or fired—just short of their cliff, they may walk away with no stock ownership at all, sometimes through no fault of their own, as in the event of a family emergency or illness. In situations where companies fire or lay off employees just before a cliff, it can easily lead to hard feelings and even lawsuits (especially if the company is doing well enough that the stock is worth a lot of money).<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#fn26">26</a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link" href="about:blank#fn27">27</a></li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-524351474d094aa19ec8fac99640c814"><li>🔹 As a manager or founder, if an employee is performing poorly or may have to be laid off, it’s both thoughtful and wise to let them know what’s going on well before their cliff.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-bb8788180b71415ca1e4a7e50b1ed299"><li>∑ Founders often have vesting on their stock themselves.

Your manager may well agree that is is fair for someone who has added a lot of value to the company to own stock even if they leave earlier than expected, especially for something like a family emergency. These kinds of vesting accelerations are entirely discretionary, however, unless you negotiated for special acceleration in an employment agreement.

However, often you either run afoul of the AMT trap, or don’t hold the stock long enough with the complicated 1 year + 2 year requirement, or the spread at exercise is small or zero, so the difference wouldn’t matter anyway.

It’s quite common for some companies to give offers of stock or options and tell you only the number of shares. Without the percentage, the number of shares is meaningless. Not telling you is a deeply unfair practice. A company that refuses to tell you even when you’re ready to sign an offer is likely giving you a very poor deal.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-83d2bba84b2a44f3ac7978b28e56d3e6"><li>🔸 If you’re looking at an offer, work out whether you can and should early exercise, and what the cost to exercise and tax will be, before accepting the offer.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-bd3ee4a92e2a4c6182eb12918b0f9118"><li>❗ If you join a startup right as it raises a new round, and don’t have the chance to exercise right away, they may potentially issue you the options with the low strike price, but the 409A valuation of the stock will have gone up. This means you won’t be able to early exercise without a large tax bill. In fact, it might not be financially feasible for you to exercise at all.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-af2ae2eb27e041708ca8b39cc49129b0"><li>❗ Vesting starts on a vesting commencement date. Sometimes stock option paperwork won’t reach you for weeks or months after you join a company, since it needs to be written by the lawyers and approved by the board of directors. In your negotiations, do make sure the vesting commencement date will reflect the true start date of when you joined the company, not the time at which the stock option is granted.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-769558edfb32425e98f54c95edf6bf4e"><li>🔸 The offer letter is not the actual grant of your equity. After you sign your offer letter, ensure the company delivers you your actual equity grant documents within a few weeks. It is not uncommon for early-stage startups to be sloppy with their equity granting. If they take too long to send your grant documents, the fair market value (and exercise price) of the equity could rise in the time you’re waiting, which is money lost for you.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-e6e6d925af5c46fea1ada3ee939e5c89"><li>🔸 If you’re going to early exercise, consider it like any investment. Don’t believe every projection about the value of the company you hear. Founders will tell you the best-case scenario. Remember, most startups fail. Do your research and ask others’ opinions about likely outcomes for the company.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-aa92e11144c4472d84e4807d15a90a96"><li>❗ It may not be common, but some companies retain a right to repurchase (buy back) vested shares. It’s simple enough to ask, “Does the company have any repurchase right to <em>vested</em> shares?” (Note repurchasing <em>unvested</em> shares that were purchased via early exercise is different, and helps you.) If you don’t want to ask, the fair market value repurchase right should be included in the documents you are being asked to sign or acknowledge that you have read and understood.

You might find a repurchase right for vested shares in the Stock Plan itself, the Stock Option Agreement, the Exercise Agreement, the bylaws, the certificate of incorporation, or any other stockholder agreement.</li></ul><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-0 notion-block-41af03ba7eae4044822520243d297b98" data-id="41af03ba7eae4044822520243d297b98"><span><div id="41af03ba7eae4044822520243d297b98" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#41af03ba7eae4044822520243d297b98" title="Documents and Agreements"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title">Documents and Agreements</span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-96af27b34dae46458063e63513e8aac3">This section covers a few kinds of documents you’re likely to see as you negotiate a job offer and sign on to a company.
