There is no exception to that in the field of project management. In project management, the word “customer” refers to a person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as budget and deadlines. In projects, customers can be internal or external. Internal customers are stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments. External customers are customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-dc54325045c346fdb2192800064e0e79">To successfully deliver a project, it has to meet the customer’s standards.

First, sit with the customer and ask what problem they are trying to solve. You might ask if they have a specific vision of the final outcome they would like delivered. Sometimes, customers will lean on project managers to find the solution to their problem. It’s your job to ask questions like:</div><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-12464fae738d4e0eb0a35ab261231dae"><li>What is the problem you would like us to help solve?

Once each task is done, the person responsible for that task hands that part of the project over to the next person. Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product. For example, if a graphic designer working on marketing materials for your project doesn&#x27;t understand the customer’s overall goal to appeal to educators, they may not be able to fully capture the vision for the campaign. Helping this team member understand the big picture allows them to tailor their tasks to meet the needs of the project end goal.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-39c4477a20b5447fb2692d7a4c152a84">Managing a project can be busy, but if you take the time to build relationships and maintain open lines of communication, you will increase the chances of the project’s success as well as the customer’s and your team members’ satisfaction.</div><figure class="notion-asset-wrapper notion-asset-wrapper-image notion-block-2efac5cc413d4d3e88f281b2d375e6a0"><div style="position:relative;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-self:center;width:100%;max-width:100%;flex-direction:column"><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fd3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net%2FimageAssetProxy.v1%2FSVUd4_SfT32VHeP0n599Hg_59aec878ab3546ae922bef99b4dbf88e_barriers.png%3Fexpiry%3D1646784000000%26hmac%3D1h3DccT5MetLFy95XqUjKCZSe4L0EOaP3KV5igLaETQ?table=block&amp;id=2efac5cc-413d-4d3e-88f2-81b2d375e6a0&amp;cache=v2" loading="lazy" alt="notion image" decoding="async"/></div></figure><div class="notion-text notion-block-f0f05ad938d64fb99335da0c1878f1fc">Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share ideas.

Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts.

Each member of a cross-functional team has their own unique perspective and experience, bringing different ideas and strategies to the project.</div><figure class="notion-asset-wrapper notion-asset-wrapper-image notion-block-9b2db1ed0620472ba4b8d072479de985"><div style="position:relative;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-self:center;width:100%;max-width:100%;flex-direction:column"><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fd3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net%2FimageAssetProxy.v1%2FgK_ON5v7TH-vzjeb-4x_eQ_b440f0f442de436d8131d340873a82bf_Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-6.38.09-PM.png%3Fexpiry%3D1646784000000%26hmac%3Dqam37YlE8sy0I7ySIc69EJNDqi2Y1782-_VqeWXS5lg?table=block&amp;id=9b2db1ed-0620-472b-a4b8-d072479de985&amp;cache=v2" loading="lazy" alt="notion image" decoding="async"/></div></figure><div class="notion-text notion-block-5a5e621b231c4609a5dbeb1be27ae174">Let’s explore each of these ideas in more detail.</div><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-1febcf64ac0f43c79fe6573dbf1af4f6" data-id="1febcf64ac0f43c79fe6573dbf1af4f6"><span><div id="1febcf64ac0f43c79fe6573dbf1af4f6" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#1febcf64ac0f43c79fe6573dbf1af4f6" title="Clarify goals"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title"><b>Clarify goals</b></span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-998684c647c14bb297606bf1988bd27d">When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.</div><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-d64067e42c4f4d9cad34a8df0ceb9818" data-id="d64067e42c4f4d9cad34a8df0ceb9818"><span><div id="d64067e42c4f4d9cad34a8df0ceb9818" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#d64067e42c4f4d9cad34a8df0ceb9818" title="Get team members with the right skills"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title"><b>Get team members with the right skills</b></span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-1ea25cc2f1024a4391e4cf171961b61d">Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical.

Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.</div><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-1c6406f7fa454a3f8cfce7f62b2e97c8" data-id="1c6406f7fa454a3f8cfce7f62b2e97c8"><span><div id="1c6406f7fa454a3f8cfce7f62b2e97c8" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#1c6406f7fa454a3f8cfce7f62b2e97c8" title="Recognize efforts"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title"><b>Recognize efforts</b></span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-f1d021c59031471386cae2edf03cc93f">Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others.

As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important.

Jason also puts together a small lunch gathering for his team to celebrate and recognize their hard work.</div><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-b11d78bdc8e0478692d26fb811e64cd4" data-id="b11d78bdc8e0478692d26fb811e64cd4"><span><div id="b11d78bdc8e0478692d26fb811e64cd4" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#b11d78bdc8e0478692d26fb811e64cd4" title="Key takeaway"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title"><b>Key takeaway</b></span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-3c953a7024814ee292ea693aa4ba26ad">It may seem like a lot of work to go through an entire project life cycle, but the long-term impact it will have on your project is huge! It is your job as the project manager to make sure that your leadership truly understands the risk of not properly preparing for a project. Making assumptions that are incorrect can put your company at risk. Instead, taking the time to carefully initiate, plan, execute, and close your project leads to project success and good working relationships with customers.</div><h2 class="notion-h notion-h1 notion-h-indent-0 notion-block-e60f089b67614a60a1a99e6f29b90873" data-id="e60f089b67614a60a1a99e6f29b90873"><span><div id="e60f089b67614a60a1a99e6f29b90873" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#e60f089b67614a60a1a99e6f29b90873" title="Summary of the project phases"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title">Summary of the project phases</span></span></h2><div class="notion-text notion-block-082ecc1c2dba4cbb9e528dd6c48347d0">The <b>project life cycle</b> is the path for your project from start to finish.

The department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees. This system requires communication both up and down the ladder. In a Classic structure, authority comes from the top and filters to the bottom. Frequent reporting of project status updates may be required to pass up through management levels to keep higher leaders informed.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-466b61da9a954003806343daa190da66">Classic organizations are also referred to as <b>functional</b> <b>organizations</b> because the organization is divided into departments based on function. Each department is led by a <b>functional manager</b>, and employees are grouped according to the functions of their role. For example, the main function of Friendly Skies Airlines, an airline company, is to fly airplanes. There are typically departments logically arranged to fulfill other important company functions, such as Marketing, Human Resources, and Strategy. Employees usually have a specialty within the organization and may not work within other areas during normal everyday operations.</div><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-8194d50cb1724ebcb068a9469eae1678" data-id="8194d50cb1724ebcb068a9469eae1678"><span><div id="8194d50cb1724ebcb068a9469eae1678" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#8194d50cb1724ebcb068a9469eae1678" title="Managing a project in a Classic organization"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title"><b>Managing a project in a Classic organization</b></span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-2ce24c4794c84db09d27bc1af3009dcb">Friendly Skies Airlines has a Classic organizational structure, as indicated by its reporting or “org” chart.</div><figure class="notion-asset-wrapper notion-asset-wrapper-image notion-block-e47466a473b444b18d68f1cec648b880"><div style="position:relative;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-self:center;width:100%;max-width:100%;flex-direction:column"><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fd3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net%2FimageAssetProxy.v1%2F-mxT0pKDRBqsU9KSgwQaow_7b9559eba0a84b4ba9eb145bc3fa8df1_Classic-structure.jpg%3Fexpiry%3D1646784000000%26hmac%3DxlxFwBJySRd_rdJodfMzLN4uzsHmfq2Cj82nOYDimgE?table=block&amp;id=e47466a4-73b4-44b1-8d68-f1cec648b880&amp;cache=v2" loading="lazy" alt="notion image" decoding="async"/></div></figure><div class="notion-text notion-block-ddee16f7c118408eaff6dc52cf899a78">Imagine that the Friendly Skies Airlines Board of Directors approves an initiative to retrofit existing airplanes to carry more passengers.

Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-591ad3f5d6b24fc69eb9ab1bb1b6a94e"><li><b>People: </b>Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization&#x27;s culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-2d6d962683274fd6b4f8ede2bdde6d30"><li><b>Processes: </b>Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company&#x27;s processes, and ultimately, its productivity.

How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture. You will most likely have interactions with various departments and management levels while executing projects. To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company.

In other words, organizational culture can be thought of as a company&#x27;s personality. A company’s organizational culture can help drive its internal and external success. When a company’s culture is aligned with its corporate strategy and goals, the level at which it can perform is impressive. When researching a company for a possible new job, understanding the company’s culture can help you decide if it is a good fit for you and your priorities. Also, understanding a company&#x27;s culture as a project manager can help you make informed choices about when you want your actions and decisions to fit within the culture or when you might choose to intentionally push back against the culture to effect change or create improvements.

When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes. However, just because you&#x27;re not the one directly leading the change, there are still ways in which you can support and participate in the successful adoption of your project.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-2140185d9cde4b93afefe45dccd2b1b1">As a project manager, you can think of change management as necessary for the successful outcome of your project. Both change management and project management aim to increase the likelihood of project success. They also incorporate tools and processes to accomplish that goal. The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-7920283228f841c88afd0737dfd5260c">When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:</div><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-9aa5249e08f74ced9361589e6a23db32"><li>How will the organization react to change?</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-92f038e2382c46e1800b1dfe67c9cdb0"><li>Which influencers can affect change?</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-bc6c237d62cb40209b693da682b2ea53"><li>What are the best means of communication?</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-e84bc62b33094fa398f9a355731c53dc"><li>What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?</li></ul><div class="notion-text notion-block-fdb85bbdd80441499d6e4e69bb625048">The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of possible scenarios and allow you to craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your project.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-2a54ae50590d47dab0876d757d680058">Let’s look at some best practices for approaching change management on your projects:</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-a76b87311132484cae54a08ce0ec9cb4"><b>Be proactive.</b> Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.</div><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-a2eee983914c433d8fba3b00affe66cf"><li>Incorporate change management into your project management steps.

You can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that any potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders.</li></ul><div class="notion-text notion-block-169ae98db9774d4bab26ec8b61284516"><b>Communicate about upcoming changes. </b>Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience for end users of the project deliverables. In this way, you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-40c6a309ab2d4c0e9b9ba7c7a3719e18"><b>Follow a consistent process.</b> Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. Your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-0b6baff6ac72468c8d9778debce0aa96"><b>Practice empathy.</b> Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them.

To do this, you can use job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn. Make sure the roles you select come from different companies, share similar titles, and are roles you would actually apply for. In each job description, you should be able to identify a section listing requirements for the role.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-701a9bf2f9eb40b8913d496fba672634"><li><b>Combine all the job requirements</b>.

The more commonly they appear, the more likely it is that they’re essential for the role. Put the most frequently appearing requirements at the top of your list. For example, a requirement that appears in all ten descriptions would go at the very top.</li></ul><div class="notion-text notion-block-c2ced07828824fa3a4c1e4d2baaf20b4">After completing these steps, you should have a clearer picture of which requirements are most common and important for the role. You may also have questions:</div><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-2f1708ebed204f94986cd8e5be371295"><li><b>Why do requirements differ across job descriptions?</b>
One of the most common reasons for this has to do with overly general job titles, or job titles that don’t necessarily communicate the specific scope of a given role at a particular company. For example, a program manager at one company might be focused on customer management, while at another company, the emphasis might be on project management. A Data Analyst might primarily use SQL at one company and Python at another. Because of these differences, it’s important to look beyond job titles. This is why we recommend the process outlined above—to help ensure you’re targeting the exact roles that are right for you—and that you understand the requirements for those exact roles.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-9c2273a506b947deb744b01b0af04563"><li><b>Why are some requirements higher on my list than I thought they would be, while others I expected to see barely show up at all?
</b>If you’re surprised by your results, you may need to spend more time learning what the role really entails, as you may have some preconceptions about the role that require adjusting. You might also need to do additional research to ensure you’re targeting the right roles in your job search.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-a1f468b3064d440e9b1bc56e94b9ce7c"><li><b>How do I know if I’m really right for my target role?
</b>It’s perfectly normal to experience self-doubt at this stage of the process. Remember, this is a new career for you. You’re not expected to know everything about the role, and it’s likely that your existing skills and experience won’t line up perfectly. The more you learn about the role, the better you’ll understand what’s required for success, and the more you’ll know about how to prepare yourself for that success.</li></ul><h3 class="notion-h notion-h2 notion-h-indent-1 notion-block-95e90796d08d4b8f84cfb56bc2deb3f8" data-id="95e90796d08d4b8f84cfb56bc2deb3f8"><span><div id="95e90796d08d4b8f84cfb56bc2deb3f8" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#95e90796d08d4b8f84cfb56bc2deb3f8" title="Create your professional inventory"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title"><b>Create your professional inventory</b></span></span></h3><div class="notion-text notion-block-eb6d4edb89fe4d7b90e7925900812644">For this next step, you can temporarily set aside the master list of role requirements you previously created.

Relevance is determined by whether a given skill appears on your role requirements list, how high it appears on your list, and how directly it aligns with your list.</div><div class="notion-text notion-block-0d1ed582aa26495bb0055f1e850d4160">For example, let’s say you’re interested in a program manager role. If you’re skilled at using project management software, and project management software skills are high on your job requirements list, then highlight that item in green. If you have some experience with tools that do not consistently show up on job descriptions but could still be relevant, highlight these skills in orange.</div><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-9963460b150e4fedb7b487eba1bb97d6"><li><b>Green</b><em> </em>should be used for skills that are directly relevant to your target role.

You should also highlight these skills on your resume, and be prepared to discuss them in an interview.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-ddedb95c9b1d4c4f823d77ada6f9cd9e"><li><b>Orange</b><em> </em>should be used to identify those skills and experiences that are relevant for the role but not necessarily in a direct way. These are generally your transferable skills—skills that you bring with you from past experiences that can help you succeed in your new role. Plan to have to explain these to recruiters and hiring managers, as their relevance may not be immediately evident.</li></ul><ul class="notion-list notion-list-disc notion-block-d8dd5c18471b45329f598b61e72e138d"><li><b>Red </b>should be used for items that are not relevant for your job search.

When it comes to transferable skills, you have to do the convincing, as you can’t count on a recruiter or hiring manager making the connection. For example, no job description for a project manager role calls for waitstaff experience. However, that project manager job description will likely mention excellent communication skills—which you would have developed during your hospitality career. When applying for the project manager role, make sure your resume specifically mentions excellent communication in addition to listing “waiter” or “waitress” as your previous occupation. Once you’ve categorized your skills and experience based on how well they align with the requirements for your target role, you’re ready to move your job search forward.</div><h2 class="notion-h notion-h1 notion-h-indent-0 notion-block-2c028f24c9b747b5995337c928ae9844" data-id="2c028f24c9b747b5995337c928ae9844"><span><div id="2c028f24c9b747b5995337c928ae9844" class="notion-header-anchor"></div><a class="notion-hash-link" href="#2c028f24c9b747b5995337c928ae9844" title="Course 1 Glossary"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span class="notion-h-title">Course 1 Glossary</span></span></h2><div class="notion-text notion-block-00c93ed74dcd41a0aa998d108f39943a">We’ve covered a lot of terms—some of which you may have already known, and some of which are new.

You can demonstrate how you feel about the team’s value by allowing them to have input and ask questions, and by addressing their needs as soon as possible."]]},"created_time":1646635786339,"last_edited_time":1646635740000,"parent_id":"7c5f4cc9-b8a0-498e-8484-ccc1dbf41912","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"8fa5210e-a90d-4466-bf8d-18aeea1e315c":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"8fa5210e-a90d-4466-bf8d-18aeea1e315c","version":2,"type":"image","properties":{"source":[["https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wElcha82RcCJXIWvNgXAUA_2f5c4ac359fa4a5e87b9ca3f7c558db7_C1M2L1R1_C.png?expiry=1646784000000\u0026hmac=iCgCBppJCnYxNG3BwXRBBnmM036k_Glk-edFgVCD0VQ"]]},"created_time":1646635786339,"last_edited_time":1646635740000,"parent_id":"7c5f4cc9-b8a0-498e-8484-ccc1dbf41912","parent_table":"block","alive":true,"created_by_table":"notion_user","created_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","last_edited_by_table":"notion_user","last_edited_by_id":"9e9c4442-4350-473a-b900-c954b0bd7a95","space_id":"bb9288f4-efb5-417f-bf44-1a79fa04feb1"}},"3ca01644-3a45-45ca-8fb3-71551f988d89":{"role":"reader","value":{"id":"3ca01644-3a45-45ca-8fb3-71551f988d89","version":2,"type":"text","properties":{"title":[["Maintaining customer satisfaction and building a great team are two ways that you, as a project manager, can add value to a project.

For example, if a graphic designer working on marketing materials for your project doesn't understand the customer’s overall goal to appeal to educators, they may not be able to fully capture the vision for the campaign.

One of Avi’s team members, Miguel, said that he needed to start his workday early because he picked his children up from school at 3:00. After hearing this, Avi avoided scheduling team meetings in the late afternoon. Another team member, Elisa, told Avi that she preferred face-to-face or phone conversations to email since she felt like she communicated better verbally. When Avi needed to discuss something with Elisa, he made sure that he talked with her in person as much as possible.
